This Front-End application in React accesses the back-end in Node.Js

The baseURL: 'http: // localhost: 3001 / api' that is in api.js is the path to the backend, can be configured according to your need to access.

I recommend that you use the api on the back-end to populate the mondoDB bank before accessing the front-end, because here we only make inquiries.
