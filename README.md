# React Front-End

This is a React front-end application that accesses a back-end API built with Node.js.

## Features
React-based front-end

API integration with Node.js back-end

Simple setup for connecting to MongoDB via the API

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
* git clone https://github.com/luizcurti/reactFront.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
* cd reactFront

3. Install dependencies:
* npm install

Update the baseURL in api.js to point to your back-end API.

4. Run the development server:
* npm start

## Notes
Ensure the back-end API is running, as this front-end is designed to make queries to the back-end.

It is recommended to populate the MongoDB database via the back-end API before using the front-end.
